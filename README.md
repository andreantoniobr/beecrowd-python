### About of implementation

The challenges were done gradually using resources that a Python beginner would use. OOP was not used (at least in the beginning) and Python built-in functions were used in some cases. Ex:

    n = int(input())

    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{i} x {n} = {i * n}")
